#2. Implement a python function to find the Maximum of Three numbers.

a_030 = 10
b_030 = 20
c_030 = 50

if a_030>b_030 and a_030>c_030:
    print(a_030, "is maximum among the three")

elif b_030>c_030:
    print(b_030,"is maximum among the three")
    
else :
    print(c_030,"is maximum among the three")
