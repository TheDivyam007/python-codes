#1. Write a python program to calculate the sum of Two numbers and Three numbers.
#However, if the sum is between 120 to 320 it will return 200

#For 2 numbers
a_030 = 10
b_030 = 20

sum_030 = a_030 + b_030
if sum_030>=120 and sum_030<=320:
    print("200")
else:
    print(sum_030)
    
#For 3 numbers
c_030 = 100
sum_030 = sum_030+c_030
if sum_030>=120 and sum_030<=320:
    print("200")
